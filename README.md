# AGent Framework

AGent is a powerful, flexible framework designed to create and manage agent-based workflows. It abstracts the complexity of agent-based systems, providing a simple and intuitive interface for defining agents, tools, tasks, and their relationships. Whether you are working on automation, AI-driven processes, or any workflow that involves multiple components, AGent allows you to build and manage these workflows effortlessly.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Agent-Based Workflows
- **Define agents**: Create individual agents that carry out specific tasks or manage components of your system.
- **Tool and Task Management**: Integrate tools and assign tasks to agents, making your workflows both scalable and efficient.
- **Relationships**: Establish clear relationships between agents, tasks, and tools to build dynamic and flexible workflows.

### ðŸ“š Simplified Complexity
- **Abstraction**: AGent abstracts the complexities of agent-based system design, allowing users to focus on business logic and execution rather than underlying infrastructure.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Whether you're defining agents programmatically or via a UI, AGent provides a clear and understandable syntax to manage workflows.

### ðŸ”„ Workflow Customization
- **Flexible design**: Adapt workflows to your specific requirements with ease. The framework is versatile enough to handle various use cases, from simple task automation to complex AI-driven workflows.

## Work in Progress
Note that this project is still in development, and there are many features and improvements that i'm planning to add in the future.
some of the features that i'm planning to add are:
- **parallel execution**: allow agents to run in parallel.
- **enhanced memory management**: allow agents to share memory and data in a more efficient way.
- **improved error handling**: provide better error handling and logging capabilities.
- **agent self-decision making**: allow agents to make decisions based on their environment and state.
- **self-looping agents**: allow agents to loop over their tasks and tools based on certain conditions. (currently, you need to duplicate a task and add an edge between the two tasks to loop over a task)

## Example
a simple example of how to define an agent and a task using AGent framework you can find in run.py file.
